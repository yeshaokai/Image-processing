Though the code is working and it's able to perform the tests.
However, because it's involved with openning images and plotting them,
I don't think you can run each test  without my help. Not really. 
Right now, if you run it with python, it will perform the last test, which is 
showing the animation of drawing contour in moving objects from Sequence2.
